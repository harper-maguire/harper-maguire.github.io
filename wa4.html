<p id="Intro">Introduction</p>
Game of Thrones, an HBO series, portrays a medieval country’s civil war in the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos. The story takes off as summer is ending and winter is emerging amidst battles between characters to claim the Iron Throne, the symbol of the king of the Seven Kingdoms. Backstabbing, bloodletting and fiery dragons erupt as characters battle throughout the epic, exciting, and realistic series. In the United States, although progress has been made towards gender equality, men are still highly favored and are often given more opportunities than women. HBO’s Game of Thrones reflects gender norms as male characters are given significantly more screen time. Furthermore, in general, programs in the US feature casts with more male than female characters, thus playing an active role in aiding and shaping cultural norms.</p>
<p class="Body_Paragraph">Body Paragraph</p>
<p>Throughout each season of Game of Thrones, more male characters occupy more episodes, assume a more significant portion of the script, and account for the majority of screen time for the duration of seven seasons. By using a dataset created by <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylancaster/game-of-thrones">Jeffrey Ian Caster</a>, in season one, on average, male characters speak 29% more than female characters. To compute this, I took the Caster's visualization and calculated the average amount of time a male or female character is seen throughout season one. As the series progressed, many jumped on to social media to express their dissatisfaction with gender stereotyping throughout the hit show Game Of Thrones." <a href="https://looker.com/blog/data-of-thrones-v-gender-analysis-game-of-thrones">According to Sooji Kim & Marie Newton</a>, web optimization manager and education manager at Looker, men speak 29% more lines than women in the show, and overall, fewer speaking and leading roles for women than men. As Game of Thrones progressed, female characters continued to be brutalized; however, notably, throughout Medieval society, women dealt with misogyny inherent in Game of Thrones.</p>

<p class="Body_Paragraph">Body Paragraph</p>
<p> Game of Thrones isn’t the only broadcast to depict this notion; history accounts for women's misrepresentation and lack of diversity on screen throughout time. According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/12/03/diversity-television-women-less-represented-according-nielsen/3792406001/">David Oliver</a>, from USA Today, more than one-third of cable content has a disproportionate representation for different identity groups, including women of different ethnicities and sexualities. However, as TV content continues to increase, viewers look for shows that tell their stories, leading to a more diverse representation of identity groups across the TV. Although the United States has struggled to represent women through TV adequately, some suggest that producers can increase the quality of representation by providing equal screen time and the inclusion of as many identity groups as possible. </p>

Although culture is reflected and represented through media such as television, television partakes in aiding and shaping cultural norms. For example, in Game Of Thrones’, the lack of female presences aids gender equality by failing to represent a progressive stance throughout the series. Orange is The New Black on Netflix is vital and relevant as it depicts women and their stories. The show portrayed a progressive view by presenting diverse, complex, and relatable perspectives of women never like before. According to Mary Kate Mcgrath, from Bustle, the move to independent platforms eliminates television restrictions, and there more permits TV to be more progressive than ever. TV’s shift plays a crucial role in promoting gender equality ideals by representing and promoting it throughout their broadcasts. </p>
<p>
<p id="conclusion"> Conclusion</p>
Though Game of Thrones reflected a lack of gender equality and relatively low representation of women, as TV continues to move independently, TV shows have the opportunity to gain cultural importance by reflecting a progressive view. Viewers can relate and feel empowered to implement similar notions as they see on their favorite TV show.
