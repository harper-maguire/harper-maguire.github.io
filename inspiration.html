<h1>INSPIRATION</h1>
<p>After exploring numerous websites, I found that I am drawn to organized, easily accessible, and appealing websites. <a href ="https://www.etq-amsterdam.com/">ETQ Amsterdam</a> provides a user-friendly experience as its website is well-designed and functional. For example, the website is intentionally uncluttered, enabling the user to quickly and efficiently access other parts of the website. The <a href ="https://www.mikiyakobayashi.com/">Mikiya Kobayashi</a> website is appealing to me because I appreciate how its design is minimalistic and unique. Arguably, websites that administer a minimalistic approach provide straightforward navigation and aesthetic appeal. Also, I found the interactivity and imagery utilized in <a href ="https://amandamartocchio.com/">Amanda Martcchio Architectural</a> website and <a href ="https://aaronkirman.com/">Aaron Kirmanâ€™s </a> website to be inspirational. </p>
