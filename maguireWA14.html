During this semester, we've learned many different ways of presenting information; for example, we learned to work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RevealJS, Vega, and Jupyter notebook. Given that different groups have different experiences, it's essential to communicate the same information to other specialties effectively. By analyzing a TV show earlier in the semester, I found that programs in the US feature cast more male than female characters, thus playing an active role in aiding and shaping cultural norms. The following essay demonstrates how I would present my argument through different mediums catered to unique audiences. </p>
<p>Throughout each season of Game of Thrones, more male characters occupy more episodes, assume a more significant portion of the script, and account for the majority of screen time for the duration of seven seasons. Given an audience with backgrounds in data science, I would utilize Jypter notebooks to represent data that depicts this inequality. For example, I could iterate through scripts to visually compare and contrast the inequalities of screen time. This representation would cater to an audience with backgrounds in data science as they're technologically oriented, thus understanding and modifying the content effectively. In comparison, to cater to Game of Throne's mature audiences, I would consider presenting my argument in the form of RevealJS, as mature audiences have less experience with technology. </p>
<p>The older the person, the less likely they are to embrace the internet; with that being said, RevealJS would be the most appropriate medium to convey my argument. RevealJS is a tool that enables an audience to access presentations through their web browser. Presentation slide formats create a sense of comfortability within this particular audience as it's a medium they're accustomed to. The visualizations permitted by RevealJS cater to mature audiences as visuals tend to be straightforward. The addition of a presenter may also be helpful to convey my argument because it provides the audience with the opportunity to ask further questions and elaborations. When catering to an audience with no background in data science but experience with the internet, I would consider using HTML and CSS to portray my argument. </p>
<p>Given that data science is trying to expand its reach, many young adults have little experience with mediums such as Jupyter notebooks. Despite their unfamiliarity with data science, this audience has grown up with the internet, making a medium such as HTML and CSS appropriate for my purposes. When developing websites, it's essential to consider your audience to convey a clear message. Through HTML and CSS, I can create a clear, unified message to visitors through titles, headers, images, and design styles. This demographic understands how to navigate through web pages making it the perfect medium to convey information.
