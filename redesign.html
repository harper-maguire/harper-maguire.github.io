<h1>REDESIGN</h1>
<p>Enabled by Bootstrap, a navbar is placed at the top of the page and allows users to navigate throughout the site. The navbar is customizable through different classes, for example, users can adjust the navbar’s spacing, color scheme, size, and responsive behaviors. On each of my pages, you can locate the navbar at the top of the page. I decided to implement a navbar throughout my website because I think it’s cleaner and permits a more user-friendly experience.  </p>
