<h3> Harper Maguire, INFO 3402, Weekly Assignment 2</h3>

<p>	Recently, attention has been captivated by the abnormal trading activity associated with the organization called GameStop. The "wallstreetbets" initiated a "short squeeze" by influencing an online collective to buy GameStop stock. As a result, newsworthy fluctuations in GameStop's prices and volume were reported, in addition to the billions of dollars lost for multiple Wall Street hedge funds. Reddit, Robinhood trading, Cash App, and Fidelity app enable information to be readily available to the typical person. Using these applications, an ordinary person can discover the stock market's ins and outs and implement their knowledge within investing applications within a few clicks. The implications of this recent event propose a change in the way hedge funds operate, the limitations of online social platforms, and the kinds of data researchers collect. </p>
<p>	The recent activity regarding GameStop's stock has enabled many investors to locate inefficiencies within the market, therefore pressuring hedge funds to review their current strategies. According to Goldstein, a Markets Weekly writer, GameStop's stocks reportedly were trading for $18; however, shortly after, the price per stock reached $364.15. The sudden growth challenged multiple hedge fund prognoses and resulted in billions of dollars lost. The pandemic promotes trading as individuals spend more time at home and the production of apps enabling users to reach the market through their phones. Hedge funds need to account for and incorporate the implications of new markets and applications by perhaps conducting additional research. I think that by assigning resources to investigate trends within these applications, maybe hedge funds will be better equipped to predict shorted stocks and trends. </p>
<p>	Hedge fund strategies have operated and worked well throughout the years; however, individuals are beginning to recognize and manipulate longer-term strategies with the growing market and increase in market applications. Market participants are empowered by the accessibility of market applications and information because they allow participants to engage in collective action. In this instance, the collaborative effort resulted in the loss of billions of dollars and suggested the necessary limitations. Based on my knowledge, I am not sure how one would limit collective action on social media. However, given this example in combination with the recent event at the Capital, I think it's essential we begin researching ways to regulate collective action. Perhaps algorithms can be administered to detect and alert those concerned about collective action, and limitations can be dealt with depending on the situation.</p>
<p> Given the power aided and embedded by social media, I think it's vital that researchers uncover collective action methods. As we become more technologically advanced, information and communication become more accessible. Thus enabling mass movements, outrage, and change. I think researchers should look to uncover, "how can algorithms eliminate the harmful effects of some collective actions?" By doing so, we could also find ways in which we can help positive movements flourish. I'm not saying that we should strive to control all mass movements. However, I think it's important to be made aware of brewing movements. For example, had algorithms detected GameStop stocks' conversation, perhaps the knowledge would help eliminate or decline the event's injury. It's becoming more important than ever to be knowledgeable of potential collective action as social media and other technologies continue to enhance the speed and distance we communicate. </p>
<p>	As an information science student, I've discovered that information is at my fingertips at any given moment. I became amazed at how accessible information is and how far it can travel. As I've progressed as an information science student, I continue to be enthralled by the power of technology. However, at times I fail to see the potential harm from it. The ability to communicate and share information with a click of the button in many instances has caused damage. For example, the Capital or the GameStop event was proposed and planned through social media and collective action. Although these limitations of the technology are bad </p>
